# My Front-End Boilerplate

Tired of setting up bootstrap, bower, sass, and browserify every time? Here ya go

## Getting it

Of course, you can do a normal `git clone` if you want. But you may want to just download the boilerplate and not keep all of the commit history and branches for this project. It is likely that you will want the boilerplate to start a **new** git project. There are many ways to do this, but here is my favorite:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mattdodge/front-end-boilerplate <project name>
cd <project name>
rm -rf .git
git init
```

## Using it

After getting it...

```bash
npm install
bower install
```
